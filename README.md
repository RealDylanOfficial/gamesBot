# gamesBot
Small discord bot which plays simple games in the channel.
Currently only has hangman against computer. (/hangman against:computer)
I plan to add hangman against other users and naughts and crosses.

## Setup
Create config.json in the main directory and populate it with the following fields:  
{  
    "clientId": "",  
    "token": "",  
    "guildId": ""  
}

Run bot with "node server.js" in the main directory.
